# Post-Surgical-Brain-Tumor-Detection


Post-Surgical Brain Tumor Detection 

This project focuses on detecting post-surgical brain tumor regions from MRI images using deep learning.
It is part of the ADS Project by Archie Maini (Roll No: 2410998515), Chitkara University.

The system takes an MRI scan as input and predicts whether tumor tissue is still present after surgery.
A simple frontend allows users to upload MRI images, while the backend processes the file through a trained deep learning model.

⭐ Features

✔️ MRI image upload from a web interface

✔️ Automated detection of post-surgical brain tumor regions

✔️ Deep learning model built using PyTorch

✔️ Preprocessing pipeline for image normalization

✔️ Output with prediction & confidence score
